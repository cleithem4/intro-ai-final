Hello!

This is our Backgammon AI.
By: Peter Manolis, Cody Leithem, and Mark Dzwonczyk

To run the game is very simple. 

1. Go to the main.py file.
2. Set the seed to whatever number you want.
3. initalize player 1 and 2 to either a minimax player or an alpphabeta pruning player. This is done by writing the following.
     1. In the case where you want an alpha beta player -> Player1 = PlayerAB(max_depth=x)
     2. In the case where you want a minimax player -> Player1 = PlayerMM(max_depth=x)
4. Set max_depth to what you desire. We recommend you keep this under 5.

There are no depencies needed to run the game. Simply just download the files we have in this github.

Thank you and enjoy.
